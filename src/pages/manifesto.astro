						<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-monochrome">Introduction</h2>
						<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome-muted">
							Do you have a Spotify account? Then you're part of a system that exploits the very artists you love. Your subscription doesn't fund creativity or passion. It fills the pockets of shareholders, managers and millionaires like Taylor Swift.
						</p>
						<h3 id="values" class="text-2xl font-bold text-monochrome">Our Values</h3>
						<ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4 text-lg text-monochrome-muted">
							<li><strong>Artists first. Not corporates.</strong> Creativity belongs to the artists, not to those who exploit its value.</li>
							<li><strong>Music for people. Not capitalism.</strong> By artists for fans, not for shareholders profit and algorithms.</li>
							<li><strong>Music is art. Not content.</strong> It's meaningful, not fast food or background noise for engagement metrics.</li>
							<li><strong>Created by humans. Not AI.</strong> Emotion, imperfection and human connection can't be replicated by AI.</li>
							<li><strong>Own it. Not rent it.</strong> Artists and fans should own their music, not tied to subscriptions.</li>
							<li><strong>Open. Not gatekeeping.</strong> Music is culture and everyone should be able to participate in it.</li>
						</ol>
						<h3 id="overview" class="text-2xl font-bold text-monochrome">Overview</h3>
						<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome-muted">
							Streaming has turned music into background noise for capitalism. Out of every €10.99 you pay, artists see around €0.74 and most of that goes to the top one percent. The rest disappears into corporate profits. </p>
						<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome-muted">
							Even money-making artists have called this system out, but the platforms and the major labels keep tightening their grip. They own the stage, the audience and the algorithm. They've built a culture that treats music like fast food and musicians like disposable workers. </p>
						<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome-muted">
							Music should not be a product, a spreadsheet, or a marketing strategy. It's human, emotional, messy, and it deserves better than a corporate algorithm deciding who gets heard.
						</p>
						<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome-muted">
							To take back the music industry, we believe it requires a nonprofit and open-source community. No CEOs. No investors. No bullshit. Built by musicians and listeners who still believe music can be fair.
						</p>
						<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome-muted">
							Because art belongs to everyone. And the industry has stolen enough. </p>
					</section>

					<section class="space-y-6">
						<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-monochrome">Problem</h2>
						<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome-muted">
							The market power of these streaming platforms is overwhelming. As an artist, you're essentially forced to work with them because of their monopoly position, even though they act against the interests of artists.
						</p>
						<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome-muted">
							Every artist suffers. Their creativity fuels the system, yet they receive only crumbs in return. The result is a generation trapped between relentless self-promotion, burnout, and the illusion of exposure instead of fair pay.
						</p>
						<h3 id="pyramid-scheme-payout" class="text-2xl font-bold text-monochrome">Pyramid Scheme Payout</h3>
						<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome-muted">
							Streaming has become one of the largest and most exploitative pyramid schemes of modern times. The artists we love sit at the bottom, even though they create the real value for their fans.
						</p>
						<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome-muted">
							Even if you only listen to small independent artists, your monthly fee doesn't reach them. Around 93% of what you pay goes to the platform, major labels, managers and millionaires like Taylor Swift. Even if you've never played a single song of theirs.
						</p>
						<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome-muted">
							The majority of musicians earn between €0 and €50 per month and Spotify keeps the exact numbers secret. This is not a platform built to support music. It is a platform built to extract wealth from the many and reward the few.
						</p>
						<h3 id="maximizing-shareholder-revenue" class="text-2xl font-bold text-monochrome">Maximizing Shareholder Revenue</h3>
						<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome-muted">
							The pyramid exists for one reason: Hyper-capitalist platforms like Spotify exist to serve profit. Every feature, playlist, and algorithm is designed to maximize shareholder returns, not support artists. There is only one goal. Profit.
						</p>
						<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome-muted">
							With monopoly-like market power, these platforms set the rules of the music industry. Artists have little choice but to comply, even as the system exploits them. It is interested in feeding the profits of investors and tech bros.
						</p>
						<h3 id="music-made-for-algorithms" class="text-2xl font-bold text-monochrome">Music made for Algorithms</h3>
						<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome-muted">
							In today's streaming world, artists don't make music for humans, they make it for algorithms. Songs are engineered to fit formulas: Under three minutes, catchy intros, repeated hooks. Creativity takes a back seat to predictability.
						</p>
						<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome-muted">
							The result? Music is written to maximize clicks and streams, not to move listeners. Emotional depth and risk-taking are punished, and originality becomes a liability. Art turns into disposable content.
						</p>
						<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome-muted">
							Platforms don't care about culture. The songs you hear most aren't the best or most meaningful, just the ones designed to keep you hooked and feed the corporate machine.
						</p>
						<h3 id="ai-songs-and-bot-farms" class="text-2xl font-bold text-monochrome">AI Songs & Bot Farms</h3>
						<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome-muted">
							Human artists now face a new threat: AI-generated songs and bot farms. These fake streams steal revenue and ideas from creators who pour their creativity into their work. Every artificial play takes money and exposure from real artists.
						</p>
						<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome-muted">
							There's no incentive to stop it, as the system rewards scale over substance. Platforms profit by paying artists less, and many of these AI tracks and bot streams are likely controlled or even created by the platforms themselves.
						</p>
						<h3 id="pay-2-play-playlists" class="text-2xl font-bold text-monochrome">Pay-2-Play Playlists</h3>
						<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome-muted">
							The playlist economy has been hijacked by money. A secondary market has emerged where playlist owners sell spots to the highest bidder. If you're an artist with no budget, you don't stand a chance. </p>
						<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome-muted">
							This system doesn't reward talent or creativity. It rewards money. Streaming was supposed to democratize music discovery. Instead, it has become a pay-to-win game, where financial muscle replaces artistic merit. </p>
					</section>

					<section id="solution" class="space-y-6">
						<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold" style="color: var(--monochrome-text)">Solution</h2>

						<h3 id="artist-first" class="text-2xl font-bold text-monochrome">Artist First</h3>
						<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome-muted">
							Artists create the real value for their fans, not the distribution technology.

							They are the heartbeat of culture and they deserve to be at the very top.
</p>
	<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome-muted">
							100% of all streaming revenue goes directly to the artists you listen to.

							The platform is funded through donations and optional additional features.

							Streaming money always remains with the artists. No exceptions.
						</p>

						<h3 id="stream-2-own" class="text-2xl font-bold text-monochrome">Stream-2-Own</h3>
						<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome-muted">

Streaming should not mean renting culture forever. With Stream-2-Own, every listen builds ownership. Once a song has been streamed a defined number of times it becomes yours.
</p>
	<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome-muted">
Downloading it, keeping it forever, storing it locally, and leaving the platform without losing access are all part of the model. No lock-in. No endless subscriptions. Just music that is actually owned.

						</p>

						<h3 id="no-ai-policy" class="text-2xl font-bold text-monochrome">No-AI Policy</h3>
						<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome-muted">
							We have a strict No-AI policy.

							A verification process ensures that only human artists are allowed to release songs.

							Additionally, through an automated and community-driven process, we ensure that no AI-generated songs can be published.
						</p>

						<h3 id="nonprofit" class="text-2xl font-bold text-monochrome">Nonprofit</h3>
						<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome-muted">
							We are a nonprofit because we refuse to play the game of endless growth and corporate greed.

							No shareholders. No art sacrificed at the altar of profit.

							We exist to dismantle the broken system.

							The one where streaming platforms rake in billions while artists scrape for crumbs.
</p>
	<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome-muted">
						This is ensured structurally and legally by operating as a registered nonprofit association under German law. Private ownership and value extraction are impossible. There are no shares to sell, no owners to satisfy, and no mechanism to turn culture into private profit.	</p>

						<h3 id="open-source" class="text-2xl font-bold text-monochrome">Open Source</h3>
						<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome-muted">

						Culture belongs to everyone, not to closed platforms. The entire organization and platform are therefore open source. All technology is public, auditable and open for contribution so that participation remains open to all.
	</p>
		<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome-muted">
                   Public roundtables allow anyone to join discussions and help shape decisions. Membership in the association is open, enabling active contribution to the platform and its community.
