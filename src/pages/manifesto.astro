                <section id="overview" class="space-y-6">
                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-monochrome">Introduction</h2>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome">
                        Do you have a Spotify account? Then you're part of a system that exploits the very artists you love. Your subscription doesn't fund creativity or passion. It fills the pockets of shareholders, managers and millionaires like Taylor Swift. </p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-monochrome">Our Values</h3>
                    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4 text-lg text-monochrome">
                        <li><strong>Artists first. Not corporates.</strong> Creativity belongs to the artists, not to those who exploit its value.</li>
                        <li><strong>Music for people. Not capitalism.</strong> By artists for fans, not for shareholders profit and algorithms.</li>
                        <li><strong>Music is art. Not content.</strong> It's meaningful, not fast food or background noise for engagement metrics.</li>
                        <li><strong>Created by humans. Not AI.</strong> Emotion, imperfection and human connection can't be replicated by AI.</li>
                        <li><strong>Own it. Not rent it.</strong> Artists and fans should own their music, not tied to subscriptions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Open. Not gatekeeping.</strong> Music is culture and everyone should be able to participate in it.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-monochrome">Overview</h3>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome">
                        Streaming has turned music into background noise for capitalism. Out of every €10.99 you pay, artists see around €0.74 and most of that goes to the top one percent. The rest disappears into corporate profits. </p>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome">
                        Even money-making artists have called this system out, but the platforms and the major labels keep tightening their grip. They own the stage, the audience and the algorithm. They've built a culture that treats music like fast food and musicians like disposable workers. </p>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome">
                        Music should not be a product, a spreadsheet, or a marketing strategy. It's human, emotional, messy, and it deserves better than a corporate algorithm deciding who gets heard.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome">
                        To take back the music industry, we believe it requires a nonprofit and open-source community. No CEOs. No investors. No bullshit. Built by musicians and listeners who still believe music can be free and fair.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome">
                        Because art belongs to everyone. And the industry has stolen enough. </p>
                </section>

                <section id="problem" class="space-y-6">
                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-monochrome">Problem</h2>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome">
                        The market power of these streaming platforms is overwhelming. As an artist, you're essentially forced to work with them because of their monopoly position, even though they act against the interests of artists.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome">
                        Every artist suffers. Their creativity fuels the system, yet they receive only crumbs in return. The result is a generation trapped between relentless self-promotion, burnout, and the illusion of exposure instead of fair pay.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-monochrome">Pyramid Scheme Payout</h3>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome">
                        Streaming has become one of the largest and most exploitative pyramid schemes of modern times. The artists we love sit at the bottom, even though they create the real value for their fans.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome">
                        Even if you only listen to small independent artists, your monthly fee doesn't reach them. Around 93% of what you pay goes to the platform, major labels, managers and millionaires like Taylor Swift. Even if you've never played a single song of theirs.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome">
                        The majority of musicians earn between €0 and €50 per month and Spotify keeps the exact numbers secret. This is not a platform built to support music. It is a platform built to extract wealth from the many and reward the few.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-monochrome">Maximizing Shareholder Revenue</h3>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome">
                        The pyramid exists for one reason: Hyper-capitalist platforms like Spotify exist to serve profit. Every feature, playlist, and algorithm is designed to maximize shareholder returns, not support artists. There is only one goal. Profit.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome">
                        With monopoly-like market power, these platforms set the rules of the music industry. Artists have little choice but to comply, even as the system exploits them. It is interested in feeding the profits of investors and tech bros.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-monochrome">Music made for Algorithms</h3>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome">
                        In today's streaming world, artists don't make music for humans, they make it for algorithms. Songs are engineered to fit formulas: Under three minutes, catchy intros, repeated hooks. Creativity takes a back seat to predictability.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome">
                        The result? Music is written to maximize clicks and streams, not to move listeners. Emotional depth and risk-taking are punished, and originality becomes a liability. Art turns into disposable content.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome">
                        Platforms don't care about culture. The songs you hear most aren't the best or most meaningful, just the ones designed to keep you hooked and feed the corporate machine.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-monochrome">AI Songs & Bot Farms</h3>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome">
                        Human artists now face a new threat: AI-generated songs and bot farms. These fake streams steal revenue and ideas from creators who pour their creativity into their work. Every artificial play takes money and exposure from real artists.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome">
                        There's no incentive to stop it, as the system rewards scale over substance. Platforms profit by paying artists less, and many of these AI tracks and bot streams are likely controlled or even created by the platforms themselves.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-monochrome">Pay-2-Play Playlists</h3>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome">
                        The playlist economy has been hijacked by money. A secondary market has emerged where playlist owners sell spots to the highest bidder. If you're an artist with no budget, you don't stand a chance. </p>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-monochrome">
                        This system doesn't reward talent or creativity. It rewards money. Streaming was supposed to democratize music discovery. Instead, it has become a pay-to-win game, where financial muscle replaces artistic merit. </p>
