The music industry sold its soul. We’re taking it back.

1. Artists first. Not corporates. Creativity belongs to the artists, not to those who exploit its value.
2. Music for people. Not capitalism. By artists for fans, not for shareholders profit and algorithms.
3. Music is art. Not content. It's meaningful, not fast food or background noise for engagement metrics.
4. Created by humans. Not AI. Emotion, imperfection and human connection can't be replicated by AI.
5. Own it. Not rent it. Artists and fans should own their music, not tied to subscriptions.
6. Open. Not gatekeeping. Music is culture and everyone should be able to participate in it.
